# Pizza Shop Sales Analysis
Overview - Create a single page dashboard using the given data set and visualize the following objectives.
**Objective:**
1. Peak and Low Order Times: Determine the time periods with the highest and lowest order volumes.
2. Busiest Day of the Week: Identify the day with the most pizza orders.
3. Total Sales Calculation: Analyze the overall sales generated.
4. Most Popular Pizza: Find out which pizza variety is ordered the most.
5. Top Revenue-Generating Pizza: Identify the pizza contributing the most to sales revenue.
6. Order Time Analysis: Analyze the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night) when pizza orders peak.
7. Identify which pizza category is hot-selling

**Data Sources**
The dataset for this MIS project was sourced from another contributor's repository and includes data spanning one year of pizza sales. The dataset was provided in four separate files:
- **Order Details**: Contains information about individual order items, including quantities and prices.
- **Orders**: Provides the overall order data such as order IDs, customer information, and timestamps.
- **Pizza**: Lists the different pizza varieties available, including their sizes.
- **Pizza Type**: Includes details about each pizza type, like ingredients and category.

The original dataset was mostly cleaned, but I further refined and enhanced it using Power BI to extract additional insights.

**Analysis Process**
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Imported the datasets into Power BI and utilized Power Query for additional data cleaning.
   - Extracted hidden details such as the day of the week, and time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night) to enrich the analysis.
   - Performed data transformations to ensure consistency and readiness for analysis.

2. **Calculating KPIs**:
   - Used DAX functions to create various measures and calculated columns required for the analysis. These included metrics like total sales, order counts, average sales per order, and popular order times.

### **Visualization Techniques**
- Created a dynamic Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights.

This comprehensive analysis provided valuable insights into the pizza shop's sales patterns, helping identify peak ordering times, best-selling pizzas, and the most profitable items.
